<b>Instructions</b>
</p>
<p>
  Welcome! In this experiment, you'll be reading some short passages and be asked whether these passages make up a coherent story or not. Each passage will be presented to you <b>one word at a time</b>, and after each one, you will be asked to make your judgement. 
  </p>
  <p>
  Each passage will begin with a series of dashed lines, like this:
  </p>
<p>
— —
</p>
<p>
  Once you press the <b>spacebar</b>, the passage will be presented to you one word at a time in the center of the screen. Please <b>read each passage silently to yourself (Do not read out loud!)</b>, paying close attention while you are reading so you will be ready to make a judgment about whether the passage was coherent or not.
  </p>
  <p>
    At the end of each passage, you will be prompted to make your judgment by "???". Please respond <b>quickly and accurately</b> to whether the passage was coherent or not. Press <b>J</b> if the passage is coherent/good, and <b>F</b> if it is not coherent/bad.
  </p>
  <p>
You will be asked to take a short break for 10 seconds every now and then between passages, but please do not do so when you are in the middle of a passage.
</p>
  <p>  
  This experiment requires your <b>full attention</b>. The experiment should take no more than 60 minutes, but during this time you must give your complete attention.
